                    A skill is a Markdown file of instructions
                    an AI agent loads when a task calls for
                    it. The Hino skill teaches an agent Hino's
                    rules (tokens, not hex values; strings
                    from the app; one entry point per control)
                    and every component's import, so the code
                    it writes looks like code written here.
